the box model
    everything on a website is a rectangular box 

    these boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another

    put a border arouond items to visualize the boxes
        * {
            border: 2px solid red;
        }
    
    there are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes and the space between them using "padding", "margin", and "border"
        "padding" increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it.

        "margin" increases the space between a box and any others that sit next to it.

        "border" adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.

use this to set the sixe of an element (with the margin and all) into the size of the set height
    box-sizing: border-box;
