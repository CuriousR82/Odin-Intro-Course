so far we used the "flex: 1" rule to all items, but flex is also useful for arranging items that have a specific size.

"flex: 1" makes each of th eitems grow to fill the available space. 

but what if we want them to stay the same width, but distribute themselvees differently inside the container?
    remove "flex: 1" from the ITEMS and add "justify-content: space-between" to CONTAINER 

"justify-content" aligns items across the MAIN AXIS.
    main axis is the x-axis.

"align-items" places items along the CROSS AXIS.
    cross axis is the y-axis. 

    when you add "align-items: center" to CONTAINER, it will align all the items in the container to be in the center of the y-axis of the container.

when you change the flex direction from row to column, "justify-content" will align vertically, and "align-items" will align horizontally.



"gap" property
    adds a specified space between flex items, very similar to adding a margin to the items themselves.

    add "gap: npx;" to the CONTAINER, then the gap applies to the items inside the container.

"flex-wrap: wrap"
"flex-warp: nowrap"

"flex-direction" and "flex-warp" combined is "flex-flow", the first value of it would be the direction, and the second value is the warp.
    ex.) flex-flow: row wrap;
